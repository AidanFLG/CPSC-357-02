pseudo-code


1.1:

Create a isPrime function and pass a Int through and return a bool
	//so that the for loop doesnâ€™t break if 1 or 0 gets passed through it
	Do and if function. If the number is 0 or 1 return true;
	//gets every number up to that number
	Do a for loop to go through every number from 0 to before that number
		//checks to see if the number is prime
Take that number and check if the given number REMAINDER(%) the number equals 0, return false. Loop through every number and if they are all not 0 then return true



1.2:


Write a function that takes in 4 Ints and returns a string
Make a counter for the time
	Write a while loop to increment the original minutes till it reaches the final time
		If function for if minutes go over 60 hour increases and mins go to 0


1.3:

write a function that takes in a string and returns a bool
	Make a counter
	For function to loop though every char in the string
		If it is a ( count += 1
		If it is a ) count -= 1
		If count is negative return false
	If count == 0, return true, if not, return false
